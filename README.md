# Todo_Flexhire
This is the [Flexhire assignment](https://flexhire.com/application/assignments/168), I'm doing it as a way for me to learn more about Android's [architectural components](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide), and how mvvm pattern would enhance App's maintainablility

#### pending tasks
* Using [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) to store data locally, for a better ux
* Using a Dependancy Injection (like [Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev/)) to ease testing
* [Testing each component](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#test-components)
